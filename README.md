# Apriscout

An intuitive and clean tool to track and share your Aprimon collection.

Provides a visible way of managing your Aprimon collection, whether for your own personal tracking or you want to quickly share to others what are missing or seeking. You can add the Pokemon you desire and track them across all or just some apriballs.

## Features

- Your own tracked database of Pokemon
- For each Pokemon and apriball, you can designate them with several categories: 'collected', 'uncollected' or even highlight as 'desired'
- All displayed in a nice graphical formatting
- No setting up or managing your own spreadsheets


## Future Features

- Separate into 'boxes' or several categories.
- Tools to quickly add many Pokemon at once - a generation, starters, etc.

I am always eager to hear your ideas or suggestions to improve this application! Feel free to get in contact, either submitting them through Github or the contact information available on my Github profile.
